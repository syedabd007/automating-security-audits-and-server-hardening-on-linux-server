# Linux Server Security Automation Project

This project provides a collection of Bash scripts designed to automate security audits and hardening on Linux servers. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of system security, from user and group audits to firewall configuration, network monitoring, and more. The scripts are modular, allowing for easy integration and customization.
