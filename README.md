# Linux Server Security Automation Project

This project provides a collection of Bash scripts designed to automate security audits and hardening on Linux servers. Each script focuses on a specific aspect of system security, from user and group audits to firewall configuration, network monitoring, and more. The scripts are modular, allowing for easy integration and customization.

## User and Group Audits

**Script:** `user_group_audit.sh`

This script audits all users and groups on the server, identifying potential security risks such as unused accounts or accounts with improper permissions.

**Usage:**

File and Directory Permissions

Script: filesystem_status.sh

Description:
This script checks the permissions of critical files and directories on the server. It ensures that sensitive files are not accessible to unauthorized users and that directory permissions are set according to security best practices. Misconfigured file permissions can lead to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash filesystem_status.sh
Service Audits

Script: service_monitor_macos.sh

Description:
This script audits the status of essential services such as SSH, Nginx, and iptables (firewall). It verifies that these services are running, properly configured, and not exposed to unnecessary risks. Regular service audits are crucial for maintaining the integrity and security of the server.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash service_monitor_macos.sh
Firewall and Network Security

Script: network_monitor.sh

Description:
This script monitors network connections and firewall rules on the server. It checks for open ports, unauthorized connections, and potential vulnerabilities in the network configuration. Ensuring that the firewall is correctly configured and that the network is secure is vital for protecting the server from external threats.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash network_monitor.sh
IP and Network Configuration Checks

Script: ip_network_config_check.sh

Description:
This script checks the server's IP and network configurations, including IPv4 and IPv6 settings. It verifies that the server's IP addresses are correctly configured and that network interfaces are secure. The script can also distinguish between public and private IPs, helping to ensure that sensitive systems are not accidentally exposed to the internet.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash ip_network_config_check.sh
Security Updates and Patching

Script: security_updates.sh

Description:
This script automates the process of checking for and applying security updates and patches on the server. Keeping the server's software up to date is one of the most effective ways to protect against vulnerabilities and exploits. The script ensures that all critical updates are installed promptly.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash security_updates.sh
Log Monitoring

Script: log_monitoring.sh

Description:
This script monitors system logs for signs of suspicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts, system errors, or security breaches. It can alert administrators to potential issues that need immediate attention. Regular log monitoring is essential for early detection of security incidents.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash log_monitoring.sh
Server Hardening Steps

Script: server_hardening.sh

Description:
This script applies various hardening measures to the server, such as disabling unnecessary services, securing SSH access, enforcing strong password policies, and more. Server hardening is a critical step in reducing the attack surface and protecting the server from potential threats.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash server_hardening.sh
Custom Security Checks

Script: custom_security_checks.sh

Description:
This script performs custom security checks tailored to your specific environment. It allows you to implement and enforce your organization's security policies, ensuring compliance with internal and external security standards.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash custom_security_checks.sh
Reporting and Alerting

Script: reporting_alerting.sh

Description:
This script generates a comprehensive report of the security audit and sends alerts if any critical issues are found. It consolidates the results from various audit scripts and provides an overview of the server's security status. The script can be configured to send email alerts to administrators for immediate action.

Usage:

bash
Copy code
bash reporting_alerting.sh


```bash
bash user_group_audit.sh
